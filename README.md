# Milk Quality and Level Monitoring System

This project presents a comprehensive report and code for an automated milk quality and level monitoring system. The system uses multiple sensors (ultrasonic, load cell, pH, TDS, temperature, gas, and color) to monitor milk quality and quantity in real time. The report includes system design, working principles, cost breakdown, and sample Arduino code.
